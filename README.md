# Minimal example of useCssVar with different parameters

Showcases a problem with `useCSSVar`-function, where it does not get the variable without a target.
On my machine (Fedora 41, chrome/edge/firefox), the first line where `useCSSVar` is used with only the first parameter, the color is undefined.

## To run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
